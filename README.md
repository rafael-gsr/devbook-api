# Hello there

This is my first go api, and I'm very excited with the language and the new features.

But I'm not a professional go programmer, so forgive me the for the bad patterns
that will be written kkkkk.

If you want to give me some advice, please do it. You are welcome.

## The project

This api will focus on the creation of users and posts.

### User Schema

- ID -> uint
- Name -> charset
- Nick -> chatset unique
- Email -> charset unique
- Password -> charset
- CreatedAt -> timeset

...more coming soon

## Stacks

- go
- gorilla/mux -> for routing
- go-sql-driver/mysql -> to database connection
- godotenv -> to use .env files to store the project secrets.
